# Environment Setup



## A. IDE 



IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It's a software that has everything they need to write, fix, and test their code conveniently in one place.


For this Course, we will be using VS code as our IDE and we will be coding in the same IDE.

## B. VS Code

### 1. Introduction to VS Code

VS Code, or Visual Studio Code, is a popular lightweight code editor developed by Microsoft It helps us write and run code on our machine.


### 2. Setting up VS Code
To setup the VS code follow the given Instructions:


+ Visit the Official Microsoft Website for VS Code using the Following Link:
```bash
https://code.visualstudio.com/  
```       
  


+ Once you visit the link you will find a Download button there as shown:

### 3. Extensions in VS code:
                  
Extensions in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) are add-ons that expand the functionality of the editor. They're essentially small software modules that you can install to tailor the editor to your specific needs, providing additional features, and support for different programming languages, tools, themes, and more.


### Using Extensions:
                 
+ When we open the VS code we see an interface like this:

![Alt text](https://i.postimg.cc/kX6XZ6RQ/9.jpg)




+ On the left side of the VS code window we can see a sidebar with 5 different logos i.e. :

![Alt text](https://i.postimg.cc/sx8fxyqG/10.jpg)




+ Click on the last one(Blocks) from this sidebar. As you click it a menu will appear which will contain a list of extensions :

## C. GitHub


### 1. Introduction to GitHub: 

GitHub is a web-based platform designed for hosting and managing software development projects. It's a place where developers and teams store their code, collaborate on projects, track changes, and work together to build software.

### 2. Some key concepts of GitHub are:

### Repositories
Repositories, or "repos," are like folders that store all the files and data associated with a project. They can be public or private and contain everything from code files to images or documents.

### Branches
Branches in VS Code, much like in other version control systems, are separate paths for your code changes. They allow you to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase directly. 


### Commits
Commits are essentially saved checkpoints of your code. They capture all the changes you've made at a specific point in time, acting like snapshots that preserve the history of your project. Each commit is accompanied by a message that describes the changes you've made. These commits help you keep track of the development progress, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed and collaborate effectively by sharing your changes in a structured manner.

### Pull Requests (PRs)
A pull request is a request to merge changes made in a branch into another branch, usually the main branch (e.g., merging a feature branch into the master branch).Pull requests facilitate collaboration and code review. They allow team members to discuss changes, review the code, and ensure that the proposed changes meet the project's standards before merging.

### Issues
Issues are used to track bugs, tasks, or feature requests related to a repository. They serve as a communication tool to discuss problems or propose enhancements. Issues help organize and priorities work by providing a centralized place for discussion, assigning tasks, and tracking progress.







### 3. Creating a GitHub Account:
           
+ Go to github.com in your web browser.
+ Click on the "Sign Up" button.
+ Enter your email address, a username, and a secure password.
+ Complete the verification process.
+ Configuring Your Profile


### 4. Cloning Repositories:

Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of a repository from GitHub onto your computer. To clone a repository:

+ Go to the repository on GitHub that you want to clone.

+ Click on the "Code" button and click on “Download Zip”:

+ A compressed file will be downloaded. Extract this file and open this folder with VS Code.  


### 5. Creating a Repository:

+ Open your web browser and go to github.com. Log in to your GitHub account if you haven't already.

+ Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner of the screen to access the dropdown menu.

![Alt text](https://i.postimg.cc/G2mbjH1s/14.jpg)



+ From the dropdown menu, select "Your repositories" or click on "Your profile" and then click the "Repositories" tab. Here, you'll find an option to create a new repository.

+ Click on the "New" button or a similar option that says "New repository." :
